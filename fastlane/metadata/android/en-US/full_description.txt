This app loads so-called "scenarios" from a self-hostable, customizable
server. Those scenarios can be provided in multiple languages, and consist of
multiple possible scenes, which in turn consist of situations that happen
between two characters (hence the "pairing" part). Those situations and
characters are picked by chance (hence the "random" part).

Just try it out by entering two or more (6+ recommended) character names and
tapping the "Randomize!" button to see what happens!

Contributions on GitHub are welcome, especially for improving or adding
translations and new scenarios to the default server.

Content warning: This is a project i'm doing for fun, and because i like to
have some NSFW fun and i don't have that much time to work on it, the "Safe
For Work" mode is not yet implemented. Sexual language and cursing may occur.
